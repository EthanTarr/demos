 In this demo, we'll explore how different metrics of disease burden tell different stories about the health burden of a country, including:

 - Deaths
 - Years of Life Lost (YLLs)
 - Years Lived with Disability (YLDs)
 - DALYs

 Data was downloaded for all-ages, both-sexes in **Colombia** in 2015 through the [GBD Compare tool](http://vizhub.healthdata.org/gbd-compare/).
